To get started:
1) Get a dictionary file from somewhere. I use ENABLE (which I
   can no longer find a decent reference for online). You'll want
   to post-process it into two separate files: one with 3-6 letter
   words (the "game" dictionary, used for picking start/end words),
   and one with 3+ letter words (the "play" dictionary, used to
   determine if a player may play a word).
2) Copy config.py.dist to config.py, and edit it, setting the paths
   to the two dictionary files above, and a path to a file within
   a writable directory for the app to store its data file.
3) python app.py <port>. The default port is 8080.
4) Visit http://localhost:<port>/
