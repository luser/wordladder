WireIt installation
--------------------

WireIt is mostly a bunch of static files.

	* download the latest WireIt zip (from http://javascript.neyric.com/wireit)
		or
	  clone the WireIt repository (http://github.com/neyric/wireit/tree/master)
	
	* Copy the following directory structure to your project's library directory:

	wireit/
 	 - build/
 	 - css/
 	 - images/
 	 - js/
 	 - lib/


WiringEditor installation
-------------------------

	* Install the  inputEx library:
		* download the latest inputEx zip (http://javascript.neyric.com/inputEx)
		* uncompress it to the wireit/lib/inputex directory

	* Configure the backend:
	  	* copy the backend/"language you want to use" directory to your wireit directory
		* edit the config script with your database access
		* make sure the backend files are accessible by your webserver and that the language module is loaded 
		  (the php backend requires a working php installation...)
